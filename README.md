## Getting Started

1. **Install** -- Download the latest APK from [Releases](https://github.com/chrisuthe/SendSpinDroid/releases)
2. **Open** -- The app searches for SendSpin servers on your network
3. **Tap** -- Select your server and you're listening

### Connecting to a Server

- **Local network**: Servers are discovered automatically via mDNS
- **Manual entry**: Tap "Enter server manually" and type your server address (e.g., `192.168.1.100:7080`)
- **Remote access**: Enter a Music Assistant Remote ID or scan a QR code to connect from anywhere
- **Proxy**: Configure an HTTP proxy for routed connections

### Requirements

- Android 8.0 (Oreo) or higher
- A [SendSpin](https://www.sendspin-audio.com/) server on your network (or a Remote ID for remote access)

### Installing the APK

Since SendSpin Player isn't on the Play Store, you'll need to allow installation from your browser:

1. Download the APK from [Releases](https://github.com/chrisuthe/SendSpinDroid/releases)
2. Open the downloaded file
3. When prompted, tap **Settings** -> enable **Allow from this source**
4. Go back and tap **Install**

## Architecture

SendSpin Player is built with native Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, using a hybrid architecture:

- **Jetpack Compose** for library browsing, search, playlists, detail screens, queue, and settings
- **XML layouts with ViewBinding** for the main activity shell, now playing screen, and server management
- **Fragments** for navigation within the bottom navigation tabs
- **ViewModels** for state management across configuration changes
- **Coroutines** for async operations and WebSocket communication
- **Media3 MediaSession** for system integration, notifications, and Android Auto

### The SendSpin Protocol

SendSpin Player speaks the [SendSpin Protocol](https://www.sendspin-audio.com/) -- a WebSocket-based streaming protocol designed for real-time synchronized audio. The server timestamps every audio chunk and each client uses precision clock synchronization to play them at exactly the right moment. The result: every speaker in your home plays the same beat at the same time.
